Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Can't find me up up and away
I give a fuck 'bout your wave
My nigga, I surf every day
Drownin' my soul
in the basement, ayy
I ain't got much in the bank
I got a lot I could say
Caught up with goddesses, hey
I hope you forgive my mistakes
Yeah,
ride around with a renegade
You should take a seat,
save your energy
I try to heal a gash
with a band-aid
And the time
I need you call your enemies
I landed in Ibiza
and I need a visa
I ain't playin'
with you this no Mamma Mia
Need a Hottie Tottie
with a body, yeah
I just spit the knowledge
then I'm out of here
(Yeah!)
That's what they yell
when we come around
(Yeah!)
This is your town
and we run it now
(Yeah!)
How big is your army,
a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!)
If you want the rain
then we comin' down
I stamp that we cool
I'm awesome,
kickflip in the Carsons
We should run for the pool
I got the fire flow,
the department exhausted
I owe nothing to you
I'm in the Tahoe,
man you making me nauseous
Pullin up with the crew
You such a hypebeast, man
You making me vomit, look—
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
It's always been
more than the music
You riding waves
in the back of my cruise ship
Look, Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it,
my nigga, you foolish
(Yeah!)
That's what they yell
when we come around
(Yeah!)
This is your town
and we run it now
(Yeah!)
How big is your army,
a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!)
If you want the rain
then we comin' down
Look, look, look
This shit is out of here
You got the heat I was not aware
Me and Bebe out in Rotterdam
Got a new man,
damn now I see him
He on the floor, in my coliseum
I hope to god
he don't sign a prenup
See my ex on the street like
I never seen her!
Watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
You see me dancing like
I'm Elvis
Just tell your man
that it's all in the pelvis
Look, watch me, watch me
Watch me, do this
Since 2012 I've been the coolest
If you do not get it,
my nigga, you foolish
(Yeah!)
That's what they yell
when we come around
(Yeah!)
This is your town
and we run it now
(Yeah!)
How big is your army,
a hunnit thou?
(Yeah!)
If you want the rain
then we comin' down
