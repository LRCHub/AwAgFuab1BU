I'M THE SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON THAT LOW HATER DIET
I'M THE SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON THAT LOW HATER DIET
'CAUSE I JUST WOKE UP
AND I FEEL SOME TYPE OF WAY
I GET ALL CHOKED UP
WHEN I SEE HOW MUCH I'VE MADE
AND I FEEL SO GOOD
LIKE JAMES BROWN IN HIS DAY
SINGING "HEY HEY HEY"
WATCH ME DO (WATCH ME!)
WATCH ME DO (WATCH ME!)
WHAT I DO (WATCH ME!)
AND LET ME HEAR YOU SING
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) HEY
I AIN'T SAYIN' I'M THE BESTESEST
BUT I GOT NICE CURVES NICE BREASTESES
I DON'T ANSWER TEXTES FROM MY EXESES
ALL IN MY DMS LEAVIN' MESSAGES (WOO!)
HEAD SPINNIN' LIKE AN' EXORCIST
AND I AIN'T A TEACHER BUT THE LESSON IS
IF YOU WONDER HOW I MAKE IT LOOK EFFORTLESS
THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS
THAT I JUST WOKE UP (OH YEAH)
AND I FEEL SOME TYPE OF WAY
I GET ALL CHOKED UP (CHOKED UP)
WHEN I SEE HOW MUCH I'VE MADE
AND I FEEL SO GOOD
LIKE JAMES BROWN IN HIS DAY SINGIN'
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) HEY
CHORUS
I'M THE SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON A LOW HATER DIET
I'M THE SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON A LOW HATER DIET
I'M THE SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON THE LOW HATER DIET (I BEEN ON DAT)
I BEEN ON THAT SHH BE QUIET
I BEEN ON A LOW HATER DIET
'CAUSE I JUST WOKE UP (GOOD MORNING!)
AND I FEEL SOME TYPE OF WAY
I GET ALL CHOKED UP (CHOKED UP)
WHEN I SEE HOW MUCH I'VE MADE
AND I FEEL SO GOOD
LIKE JAMES BROWN IN HIS DAY
SINGIN' HEY (COME ON NOW)
HEY (COME ON NOW)
HEY (SINGIN' SINGIN') HEY
WATCH ME DO (WATCH ME!)
WATCH ME DO (WATCH ME!)
OH WHAT I DO (WATCH ME!)
AND LET ME HEAR YOU SING
HEY (HEY) HEY (HEY) (OW!)
